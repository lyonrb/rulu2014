###Venue###

This year's RuLu venue is [Comédie Odéon](https://maps.google.com/maps?um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=Com%C3%A9die+Od%C3%A9on&fb=1&hq=Com%C3%A9die+Od%C3%A9on,+Rue+Grol%C3%A9e,+Lyon,+France), "the most beautiful cafe/theatre in France". Only three short blocks from the Cordeliers stop on the Metro A line, it is very close to the historic center of Lyon at [Bellecour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_Bellecour) and the charm of [Croix Rousse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix-Rousse). 

Comédie Odéon was remodeled two years ago, and the interior is modern where it counts. The sound is clear even on the balcony, and the seats are very comfortable. Speaking of seats, there are plenty of them so you can sit with your friends. There is an attached bar with room for all of us to socialize.

###Getting to the Venue###

The most painless way to get to Comédie Odéon is by Metro. On the [TCL](http://www.tcl.fr/) site, your destination is "Cordeliers, Lyon 2eme (Arrêt)". After you arrive at the Cordeliers stop, go east toward the Rhône on Rue Grenette for one block, then turn right on Rue Grolée.

###After RuLu###
Lyon is full of things to do, see, and eat. Rue Merciere is a few blocks from the venue, a beautiful cobblestone street full of interesting restaurants. A 10-minute walk will take you to Vieux Lyon where you can take a funicular to see the Roman amphitheatre, or to Fourvière for spectacular views of the city. Or ask a local; we all love to show off our city.
