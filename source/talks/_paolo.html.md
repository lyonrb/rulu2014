#### A Problem with Frogs ####

When you tell people that you’re a programmer, they think that you
work with complicated stuff. But you know better: not everything that
you do is complicated. Most things that you do are *much worse* than
that.

This is a speech about the theory of complexity—but don’t worry, it’s
more fun than it sounds. I’ll try to answer a question that applies to
most things you do as a developer, from writing code to talking to
customers: how do you solve a problem, when you don’t even know what
the problem is?
