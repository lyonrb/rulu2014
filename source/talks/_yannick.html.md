#### Postgresql for the ruby/rails developer #### 

Frameworks tend to abstract more and more the database to provide users a similar experience using mysql, sqlite, postgresql and some even try to abstract over MongoDB. It is important to **bring back the power of the database** to the web developer.

The database is where all your data lives and is the most important piece of your architecture. **Tame your database and learn its inner power to bring a better experience to your users.** My favorite animal is PostgreSQL. What you will learn here:

- How multi columns indexes, partial indexes and functional indexes will turn your old Lada to a Lamborghini.
- JSON and Hstore columns. Bring the NoSQL to your SQL with grace. See how your tables says thanks when you stop adding columns to them every 5 minutes when a store column give you power for the next ten features.
- Arel: How to level up your ActiveRecord to do what basic it cannot do alone. I'm looking at you OR queries.
- Plain text queries in your Ruby and how it is not always SQL injection-ish. SQL can do magical stuff for you too.
- psql, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, testing indexes, using pg_stat_statements, and some queries that will tell you what is wrong with that database.
