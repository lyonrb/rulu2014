### Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?

Salut ! I'm Emily and I work on the Ruby driver to MongoDB. I also teach
Rails at Columbia University as an adjunct faculty. You can otherwise
find me running, going to concerts, or on a plane to a place I've never
been before.

### You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?

That wrap music: writing a Ruby API to wrap another API.

### Three properties:

* You code with: **Sublime**
* You test with: **RSpec**, **TestUnit**
* If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: **C**

### What Lyonnaise specialty will you give a try this year?

### What are you working on these days?

I'm splitting my time between maintaining the current Ruby driver (1.x)
and working with my team to write a new one (2.0)

### What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!

* [poodr](http://www.poodr.com/), of course.
* [Domain Driven
  Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)
* [Programming
  Pearls](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52084.Programming_Pearls) (always relevant despite the publication date!)

### Anything to add before we wrap this up?

I look forward to catching up with some rubyists I had the pleasure of
meeting at [dotrb](http://www.dotrb.eu/) last year and to meeting some new rubyists. In
particular, if you're a [mongo ruby driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver) user, let me know, I'd love to chat!
