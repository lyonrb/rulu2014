The talks are 30 minutes long, with a 20 minute break between talks. Lunch will
be provided on Thursday the 19th, and Friday (the 20th) you are free to partake
of the local cuisine; there are at least 50 restaurants within walking distance
so you can surely find something to your taste. The organizers and members of
LyonRB will be happy to help you find whatever cuisine you're looking for.

After lunch on Friday, join us at a café close to Comédie Odéon for the discussion of the
future of Ruby, a panel with audience (that's you!) participation. The
discussion is scheduled for two hours.
