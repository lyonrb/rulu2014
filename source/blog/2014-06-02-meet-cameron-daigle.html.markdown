### Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?

I'm Cameron Daigle, and I design & code at Hashrocket in Florida. I work
with lots of developers on lots of projects.

### You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?

I'm going to be talking about how to smoothly hand off design to
development (and back to design, when revisions need to be made), in
hopes of making both designers' & developers' lives easier.

### Three properties:

* You code with: **Vim**
* You test with: **Cucumber**
* If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: **Coffeescript**

### What Lyonnaise specialty will you give a try this year?

###What are you working on these days?

In addition to a varied list of client projects, I'm working on
[The Informant](http://informantapp.com/), a usability-focused error-tracking
Heroku addon (beta launch imminent).

### What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!

* [Web Form Design](http://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp) - Luke Wroblewski
* The [Hashrocket dotmatrix vim](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix)
commands
* Sandi Metz' talk "[All The Little
Things](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3358-railsconf-all-the-little-things)"

### Anything to add before we wrap this up?

Can't wait to get back to France! Come talk to me at the conference â€“
I'll be the one in a Hashrocket shirt.
