### Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?

I'm a guy who wrote a lot of software in his life, and I like to talk
about it. When it comes to Ruby, the most noticeable thing I did was
writing the Metaprogramming Ruby book.

### You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?

I'll talk about complexity theory. It sounds quite abstract, and maybe a
bit scary - but it's neither. You might find it fun.

### Three properties:

* You code with: **TextMate**

* You test with: **Cucumber, RSpec, MiniTest, JUnit**

* If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: **Python**

### What are you working on these days?

Sending the second edition of Metaprogramming Ruby to the printers.
Aaaaalmost there...

### What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!

So many. I'm all for classics, so I think that any Project Manager who
never read ["The Mythical
Man-Month"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month) should be taken to the backyard and
put out of his/her misery. Seriously, it's a book from 30 years ago, and
people could still learn basic project management from it.

### Anything to add before we wrap this up?

Nope. See you in Lyon!
