### Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?

Hi, I’m Tom. I’m a computer scientist and a Ruby programmer. I’ve
lectured on optimising compilers at the University of Cambridge, I
co-organise the [Ruby Manor conference](http://rubymanor.org/),
and I’m a member of the [London Ruby User Group](http://lrug.org/).
Last year I wrote a book for O’Reilly called
[“Understanding Computation”](http://computationbook.com/), which used Ruby to explain ideas from
theoretical computer science.

### You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?

I’ll be talking about a cool program manipulation technique called
“partial evaluation”. I’ll explain how it works, how it can be used to
make programs go faster, and what fun stuff happens when you run a
partial evaluator on itself.

### Three properties:

* You code with: **Vim**
* You test with: **Cucumber, RSpec**
* If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: **Clojure**

### What Lyonnaise specialty will you give a try this year?

### What are you working on these days?

I’m writing a self-published [ebook and screencast](http://rubywebapp.com/) about how to create a Ruby web application
without relying on a framework.

### What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!

I think Rich Hickey’s [“Simple Made Easy” talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) should be required
viewing for anyone who makes software. Likewise, Eric Evans’
[“Domain-Driven Design” book](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215), and the [GOOS book](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/), are extremely
helpful for getting to grips with the complexity of object-oriented
design.

### Anything to add before we wrap this up?

I still get daily enjoyment out of using Ruby and I’m looking forward to
hearing about what other people are doing with it at RuLu. See you
there!
