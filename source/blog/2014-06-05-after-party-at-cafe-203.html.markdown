##After Party at Café 203##
A great conference deserves a great party, so after the last talk on the 19th
we will adjourn to Café 203 to drink, dine, and unwind. It's an
appetite-enhancing 20 minute walk or a short Métro ride from the Comédie Odéon
to Café 203, a comfortable place to fill your stomach and enjoy some
conversation with your fellow Rubyists.

RuLu will cover your first drink, and you can order appetizers or an entire
meal if you wish.

###Les Burgers###
Hamburgers are quite popular in France, and with Lyon's gastronomic tradition
there are some really amazing burgers to be found. Some consider the burgers at
Café 203 to be the best in Lyon, though you can order more traditional food if
you like.

###Routes.rb###
There will be at least two groups going to the after party, one walking and one
taking the Metro. Choose a group and follow the leader. If you want to be more
independent, use your map app of choice to find **9 rue du Garet, 69001 Lyon**
or look at [this

###*See you there!*###
