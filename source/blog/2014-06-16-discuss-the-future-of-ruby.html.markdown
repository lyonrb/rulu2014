Join us on Friday after lunch to discuss the future of Ruby with a panel, a
moderator, and *you*. Yes, your participation is the secret sauce in this final
session of RuLu 2014.

The atmosphere will be casual and inclusive. To ensure that, we will meet at
[La Goutte](http://comptoir-lagoutte.com/) for this discussion, where you can
enjoy a snack and a beverage while we talk if you like.

Some possible topics for this discussion are

* Is the diversity of Ruby interpreters and compilers a strength or a weakness?
* Threading and concurrency support is inconsistent between various Ruby interpreters. Is this a real issue? How does it compare to some other languages like Erlang or Scala?
* Is Ruby mature? Is it evolving fast enough?
* Will Ruby continue to be favored as other languages such as Rust, Go and Elixir mature? What about Haskell and Erlang, and other 'academic' languages?
* The Ruby language aims to be natural and close to the programmer. As a consequence, Ruby interpreters tend to be quite complex internally and not as fast as  other languages in similar applications. How important is this?

**We all look forward to your participation in this discussion!**
