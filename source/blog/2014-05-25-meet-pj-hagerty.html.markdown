### Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?

Hi! I'm PJ! I'm a Community Engineer at Engine Yard!!

### You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?

This year at Rulu I plan to talk about The Mozart Effect - a concept
that music can unlock cognitive potential if applied correctly and
thereby make you a better coder.

### You attended Rulu in 2013. Are you excited to talk at Rulu 2014?

Hell yeah!

### What makes you come back to Rulu this year? What did you like about the previous instance?

I liked the size of the conference, the intensity. It's great to have
everyone in one place interacting and conversing.

### Three properties:

* You code with: **TextMate**

* You test with: **RSpec**

* If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: **Python**

### What's your favourite Lyonnaise specialty?

### What are you working on these days?

I'm currently working on bringing together community groups across
languages in order to better focusing on problem solving instead of just
the tools we use to solve them.

### What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people
should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!

* [Pragmatic Guide to
  Programming](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0)
* [KidsRuby](http://www.kidsruby.com/)
* [Why's Poignant Guide (for
  beginners)](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)

### Anything to add before we wrap this up?

Looking forward to Lyon!!
