### Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?

Hello! I am Arnab! I am a software developer currently living in Bangalore. I primarily work with Ruby but dabble in Clojure often. I am a language-nut and am always experimenting with new langs and technologies.

I am also into astronomy and I'll be carrying my binos with me - talk to me if you want a close up look at Mars, Saturn and Jupiter!

Oh and socc... football!

### You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?

The talk will be about new concurrency related ideas/techniques, how they feel in their natural world (such as actors in the erlang/elixir world or STM in Clojure) and if/how we can use these ideas in Ruby today.

I'll introduce a few concepts, see some use-cases and examples and applications in Ruby.

### Three properties:

* You code with: **Emacs**
* You test with: **RSpec**, **MiniTest**
* If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: **Clojure**

### What Lyonnaise specialty will you give a try this year?

### What are you working on these days?

It's complicated ;)

I just finished a long-term contract with LivingSocial, where I was primarily working on Ruby and Rails.

As soon as I am back from France, I will be hacking with the awesome folks at Bangalore based [nilenso](http://www.nilenso.com).

Apart from that, I am working on the talk, as we speak.

### What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!

* Rich Hickey's greatest hits, [Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) (and the rest of the Seven series too)
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)
* [Ruby under a microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope) (if you want to get into the innards of Ruby)
* All [Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov) novels
* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) ([org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) and [magit](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Magit) along with your regular programming modes)!

### Anything to add before we wrap this up?

This is my first trip to France! À bientôt!
