###Travelling to Lyon###
Lyon is easily reached by train or plane.  The TGV from Paris takes about 2
hours from Gare de Lyon in Paris to Lyon's Gare Part-Dieu. The
[SNCF](http://voyages-sncf.com/) site is very useful.  From the train station,
you can take public transportation to your destination.  Use the
[TCL](http://tcl.fr/) site to plan your route. Lyon's Saint Exupéry airport has
direct flights to most European cities. Pre-order your
[Rhônexpress](https://www.rhonexpress.fr/) round-trip to get to the city and
back to the airport.
