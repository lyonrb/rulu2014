###Where to Stay###
There are many
[hotels](https://www.google.com/hotels/#search;l=Lyon,+France;d=2014-06-18;n=4;usd=1;si=5180ef17;av=r)
in Lyon, and of course [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Lyon--France) and
[VRBO](http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/europe/france/rhone-alpes/lyon) can
help too. The conference venue is on the peninsula near the center of the city,
in the 2nd Arrondissement.
