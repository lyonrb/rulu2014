      </h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Decouvrir-TCL/Le-reseau">Lyon's Métro system</a> is newer than
the one in Paris, and it shows. Many of the trains are driverless, the cars are
newer and more comfortable, and the tracks are smooth. There are also three
funiculars in Lyon, and we'll give those a pass on the "smooth track" because
they have so much character.</p>

<p>There are also trams and buses under the same authority, so your tickets are
good on all modes of transportation. You'll probably be riding the trains to
get to RuLu, and hopefully you will stay for the weekend to enjoy
the city. The <a href="http://tcl.fr">TCL site</a> has links to navigation apps for iOS
and Android to help you find your way. They're useful even if you don't speak
French.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-buy-a-ticket">Step 1: Buy a ticket</h3>
<p>On the weekend you might want to get a <a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Tarifs/Tickets/Tickets-Liberte/Ticket-Liberte-1-jour">Day
Pass</a>
so you can ride all you want without interruptions to buy another ticket. The
day pass costs about the same as three
<a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Tarifs/Tickets/Ticket-a-l-unite/Ticket-a-l-unite">tickets</a>
so it's a pretty good deal if you're planning to take two round-trips or more
in a single day.  For the days of RuLu, though, you might split a <a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Tarifs/Tickets/Ticket-a-l-unite/Carnets-de-10-tickets">Carnet of 10
tickets</a>
with a friend (you <strong>are</strong> bringing friends, aren't you?) and you'll
have enough tickets to get from where you're sleeping to RuLu and back for both
days. The extra ticket will get you to the after-party if you don't want to
walk.</p>

<p>If you're planning to see <strong>all</strong> of the sights, the <a href="http://www.lyon-france.com/Lyon-City-Card/Commandez-votre-Lyon-City-Card">Lyon City
Card</a>
might work for you. It is a day pass that also includes museum entry, tours,
and lots more.
<img alt="all the things meme" src="../../img/allthesights-5d1019fd.jpg" /></p>

<p>The tickets are good for an hour, unlike the Paris Métro where a ticket is good
for a single ride. This makes it possible to use a single ticket for a quick
trip to the store or to make a reservation for a tour.</p>

<p>The transit police are very effective and have a little gadget that can print a
fine slip on the spot if you don't have a ticket or your ticket is invalid.
They have people on the trains and in the stations doing random checks. Don't
waste your time trying to get around paying for your transportation.</p>

<h3 id="plan-your-route">Plan Your Route</h3>
<p>You can use the <a href="http://tcl.fr">TCL site</a> or one of the apps linked from that
site to plan your route. The estimated walking times are usually a little long,
but keep in mind that the buses have very few time stops; if they are early,
they won't wait until the time shown on the app. You can also get maps from the
tourist offices; the best-equipped offices are at Bellecour and Vieux Lyon,
just outside the station in both places.</p>

<h3 id="go">Go!</h3>
<p>On the Métro, you will use your ticket to get to the platform after you go
downstairs into the station. On the tram and bus, look for a grey box just
above waist level near the doors and validate your ticket. If all else fails,
watch what everyone else does and do that.</p>

<p>On the trams, you may have to press the button on the door if the driver
doesn't open all doors. On the buses, there are buttons near the back doors and
in the aisle to request a stop.</p>

<h3 id="a-few-more-details">A Few More Details</h3>
<p>The trams and buses stay to the right, but the Métro is the opposite. Some
stations don't have a way to cross to the other side once you're inside the
station, but it's OK because your ticket is good for an hour. Still, it doesn't
hurt to know this so you can choose the right platform the first time.</p>

<p>If you have a chip&amp;PIN card (and if you don't know what that is, you don't have
one), you can buy tickets from the machines in each station. Otherwise you must
use coins or stand in line at one of the staffed stations. Most stations are
<strong>not</strong> staffed, so plan ahead.</p>

<p>People-watching is quite common in public places. Smile and consider it a
compliment; you're interesting!</p>
