          <p>Though strikes are less common in France than they were a decade ago, they 
still happen. Normally they don't inconvenience too many people, and the French
people generally support the rights of the workers so a little inconvenience is
tolerated. However, the current train strike is causing a lot of pain to a lot
of people, and most people don't really understand the reason for the strike.</p>

<p>We're not going to try to explain it either, sorry. But you should be aware
that it is currently hard to know whether it will get better or worse over the
next few days. Plan ahead, allow extra time for your transportation via SNCF
(and to a lesser degree, TER), and watch the <a href="http://www.infolignes.com/previsions.php?zoneId=3&amp;zoneName=Sud-Est&amp;lang=fr">info

<h3 id="could-you-introduce-yourself-in-a-few-lines">Could you introduce yourself in a few lines?</h3>

<p>Hi, I'm Konstantin Tennhard. A computer scientist from Darmstadt,
Germany. I truly love my profession; both, the scientific aspect, as
well as, the technical aspect. When it comes to computer science,
machine learning and natural language processing are the things that
fascinate me most. When it comes to building software, Ruby is probably
my number one choice, but there are other language I find particularly
fascinating: Go, JavaScript, Objective-C, Python, and R. When I'm not
building software, I spent my time with photography. I also have a
passion for good food, which is especially why I look forward to being
in France very much.</p>

<h3 id="youre-giving-a-talk-at-rulu-this-year-what-will-you-talk-about">You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?</h3>

<p>My talk is about large-scale Rails applications and the challenges we as
developers face everyday. We start with a generic discussion on two of
the most challenging aspects of software development: growth and change.
In the second half, we explore how to model complex business processes
so they can adapt to changing business requirements. Best of all, there
will be a lot of code samples.</p>

<h3 id="three-properties">Three properties:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You code with: <strong>Vim</strong></li>
  <li>You test with: <strong>RSpec</strong></li>
  <li>If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: <strong>Go</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-you-working-on-these-days">What are you working on these days?</h3>

<p>I'm doing a lot of machine learning and statistical data analysis these
days. Apart from that I maintain smart_properties and
composable_operations, which will both be covered in my talk. I'm also
admittedly a little obsessed with my shell environment. There are those
days where I almost exclusively work in the Terminal. My bash
configuration can be found on GitHub. The most interesting part about it
is probably the web-installer. It makes provisioning new VMs so much
easier.</p>

          <p>Join us on Friday after lunch to discuss the future of Ruby with a panel, a
moderator, and <em>you</em>. Yes, your participation is the secret sauce in this final
session of RuLu 2014.</p>

<p>The atmosphere will be casual and inclusive. To ensure that, we will meet at
<a href="http://comptoir-lagoutte.com/">La Goutte</a> for this discussion, where you can
enjoy a snack and a beverage while we talk if you like.</p>

<p><img alt="la goutte" title="la goutte cafe" src="../../img/la-goutte-61b446d5.jpg" /></p>

<p>Some possible topics for this discussion are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the diversity of Ruby interpreters and compilers a strength or a weakness?</li>
  <li>Threading and concurrency support is inconsistent between various Ruby interpreters. Is this a real issue? How does it compare to some other languages like Erlang or Scala?</li>
  <li>Is Ruby mature? Is it evolving fast enough?</li>
  <li>Will Ruby continue to be favored as other languages such as Rust, Go and Elixir mature? What about Haskell and Erlang, and other 'academic' languages?</li>
  <li>The Ruby language aims to be natural and close to the programmer. As a consequence, Ruby interpreters tend to be quite complex internally and not as fast as  other languages in similar applications. How important is this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We all look forward to your participation in this discussion!</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Venue picture" title="Comédie Odéon auditorium" src="../../img/comedie-odeon-a3108fb0.jpg" /></p>

<p>The talks are 30 minutes long, with a 20 minute break between talks. Lunch will
be provided on Thursday the 19th, and Friday (the 20th) you are free to partake
of the local cuisine; there are at least 50 restaurants within walking distance
so you can surely find something to your taste. The organizers and members of
LyonRB will be happy to help you find whatever cuisine you're looking for.</p>

<p>After lunch on Friday, join us at a café close to Comédie Odéon for the discussion of the
future of Ruby, a panel with audience (that's you!) participation. The
discussion is scheduled for two hours.</p>

          <p>UPDATE: The party venue has changed. We're now going to the Ayers Rock Boat.
New address is 21 Quai Victor Augagneur 69003 Lyon.
Best way not to get lost: check <a href="https://www.google.fr/maps/preview?q=ayer%27s+rock+boat+lyon&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=TsGhU5-JD8ey0QXp24DoDQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ">the map</a>.</p>

<p>A great conference deserves a great party, so after the last talk on the 19th
we will adjourn to Café 203 to drink, dine, and unwind. It's an
appetite-enhancing 20 minute walk or a short Métro ride from the Comédie Odéon
to Café 203, a comfortable place to fill your stomach and enjoy some
conversation with your fellow Rubyists.</p>

<p><img alt="Café 203" src="../../img/cafe203-305b2a5d.jpg" /></p>

<p>RuLu will cover your first drink, and you can order appetizers or an entire
meal if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="les-burgers">Les Burgers</h3>
<p>Hamburgers are quite popular in France, and with Lyon's gastronomic tradition
there are some really amazing burgers to be found. Some consider the burgers at
Café 203 to be the best in Lyon, though you can order more traditional food if
you like.</p>

<p>There will be at least two groups going to the after party, one walking and one
taking the Metro. Choose a group and follow the leader. If you want to be more
independent, use your map app of choice to find <strong>9 rue du Garet, 69001 Lyon</strong>

<p>Hi, I’m Tom. I’m a computer scientist and a Ruby programmer. I’ve
lectured on optimising compilers at the University of Cambridge, I
co-organise the <a href="http://rubymanor.org/">Ruby Manor conference</a>,
and I’m a member of the <a href="http://lrug.org/">London Ruby User Group</a>.
Last year I wrote a book for O’Reilly called
<a href="http://computationbook.com/">“Understanding Computation”</a>, which used Ruby to explain ideas from
theoretical computer science.</p>

<h3 id="youre-giving-a-talk-at-rulu-this-year-what-will-you-talk-about">You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?</h3>

<p>I’ll be talking about a cool program manipulation technique called
“partial evaluation”. I’ll explain how it works, how it can be used to
make programs go faster, and what fun stuff happens when you run a
partial evaluator on itself.</p>

<h3 id="three-properties">Three properties:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You code with: <strong>Vim</strong></li>
  <li>You test with: <strong>Cucumber, RSpec</strong></li>
  <li>If Ruby was forbidden, you would code in: <strong>Clojure</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-you-working-on-these-days">What are you working on these days?</h3>

<p>I’m writing a self-published <a href="http://rubywebapp.com/">ebook and screencast</a> about how to create a Ruby web application
without relying on a framework.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-talks-books-libraries-or-commands-you-think-more-people-should-be-aware-of---because-well-they-make-your-life-so-much-better">What are the talks, books, libraries or commands you think more people should be aware of - because, well, they make your life so much better!</h3>

<p>I think Rich Hickey’s <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">“Simple Made Easy” talk</a> should be required
viewing for anyone who makes software. Likewise, Eric Evans’
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">“Domain-Driven Design” book</a>, and the <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOS book</a>, are extremely
helpful for getting to grips with the complexity of object-oriented
design.</p>

<h3 id="anything-to-add-before-we-wrap-this-up">Anything to add before we wrap this up?</h3>

<p>I still get daily enjoyment out of using Ruby and I’m looking forward to
hearing about what other people are doing with it at RuLu. See you
there!</p>

          </h2>
          <p><a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Decouvrir-TCL/Le-reseau">Lyon's Métro system</a> is newer than
the one in Paris, and it shows. Many of the trains are driverless, the cars are
newer and more comfortable, and the tracks are smooth. There are also three
funiculars in Lyon, and we'll give those a pass on the "smooth track" because
they have so much character.</p>

<p>There are also trams and buses under the same authority, so your tickets are
good on all modes of transportation. You'll probably be riding the trains to
get to RuLu, and hopefully you will stay for the weekend to enjoy
the city. The <a href="http://tcl.fr">TCL site</a> has links to navigation apps for iOS
and Android to help you find your way. They're useful even if you don't speak
French.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-buy-a-ticket">Step 1: Buy a ticket</h3>
<p>On the weekend you might want to get a <a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Tarifs/Tickets/Tickets-Liberte/Ticket-Liberte-1-jour">Day
Pass</a>
so you can ride all you want without interruptions to buy another ticket. The
day pass costs about the same as three
<a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Tarifs/Tickets/Ticket-a-l-unite/Ticket-a-l-unite">tickets</a>
so it's a pretty good deal if you're planning to take two round-trips or more
in a single day.  For the days of RuLu, though, you might split a <a href="http://www.tcl.fr/Tarifs/Tickets/Ticket-a-l-unite/Carnets-de-10-tickets">Carnet of 10
tickets</a>
with a friend (you <strong>are</strong> bringing friends, aren't you?) and you'll
have enough tickets to get from where you're sleeping to RuLu and back for both
days. The extra ticket will get you to the after-party if you don't want to
walk.</p>

<p>If you're planning to see <strong>all</strong> of the sights, the <a href="http://www.lyon-france.com/Lyon-City-Card/Commandez-votre-Lyon-City-Card">Lyon City
Card</a>
might work for you. It is a day pass that also includes museum entry, tours,
and lots more.
<img alt="all the things meme" src="../../img/allthesights-5d1019fd.jpg" /></p>

<p>The tickets are good for an hour, unlike the Paris Métro where a ticket is good
for a single ride. This makes it possible to use a single ticket for a quick
trip to the store or to make a reservation for a tour.</p>

<p>The transit police are very effective and have a little gadget that can print a
fine slip on the spot if you don't have a ticket or your ticket is invalid.
They have people on the trains and in the stations doing random checks. Don't
waste your time trying to get around paying for your transportation.</p>

<h3 id="plan-your-route">Plan Your Route</h3>
<p>You can use the <a href="http://tcl.fr">TCL site</a> or one of the apps linked from that
site to plan your route. The estimated walking times are usually a little long,
but keep in mind that the buses have very few time stops; if they are early,
they won't wait until the time shown on the app. You can also get maps from the
tourist offices; the best-equipped offices are at Bellecour and Vieux Lyon,
just outside the station in both places.</p>

<h3 id="go">Go!</h3>
<p>On the Métro, you will use your ticket to get to the platform after you go
downstairs into the station. On the tram and bus, look for a grey box just
above waist level near the doors and validate your ticket. If all else fails,
watch what everyone else does and do that.</p>

<p>On the trams, you may have to press the button on the door if the driver
doesn't open all doors. On the buses, there are buttons near the back doors and
in the aisle to request a stop.</p>

<h3 id="a-few-more-details">A Few More Details</h3>
<p>The trams and buses stay to the right, but the Métro is the opposite. Some
stations don't have a way to cross to the other side once you're inside the
station, but it's OK because your ticket is good for an hour. Still, it doesn't
hurt to know this so you can choose the right platform the first time.</p>

<p>If you have a chip&amp;PIN card (and if you don't know what that is, you don't have
one), you can buy tickets from the machines in each station. Otherwise you must
use coins or stand in line at one of the staffed stations. Most stations are
<strong>not</strong> staffed, so plan ahead.</p>

<p>People-watching is quite common in public places. Smile and consider it a
compliment; you're interesting!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Phil Nash. I'm a Rails and front end developer from London,
working at Mint Digital. Outside of coding, I have a passion for great
beer and just started brewing my own (it doesn't taste bad!).</p>

<h3 id="youre-giving-a-talk-at-rulu-this-year-what-will-you-talk-about">You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?</h3>

<p>I'm talking about front end performance and Rails, getting together the
two sides of what I do. Performance is hugely important to the web and
how we optimise our front end is just as important as getting our
database queries running quickly. We'll look at how to make our front
end fast now and how the rules will be changing with HTTP2.</p>

<p>I'm a software developer and sometimes-scientist. In the past I've
worked for Apple and AOL, done a bit of consulting, and I even managed
to finish my Ph.D. in Computational Evolutionary Biology. These days, I
work at CircleCI, helping other devs run their tests and deploy code.</p>

<h3 id="youre-giving-a-talk-at-rulu-this-year-what-will-you-talk-about">You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?</h3>

<p>I think that Ruby is at a critical juncture in its history: it's
popularity has resulted in many other languages adopting features of
Ruby, but those languages have also started to move beyond what Ruby can
do. I'll talk a bit about where Ruby can go from here.</p>

<h3 id="you-attended-rulu-in-2013-are-you-excited-to-talk-at-rulu-2014">You attended Rulu in 2013. Are you excited to talk at Rulu 2014?</h3>

<h3 id="what-makes-you-come-back-to-rulu-this-year-what-did-you-like-about-the-previous-instance">What makes you come back to Rulu this year? What did you like about the previous instance?</h3>

<p>At last year's Rulu I met so many interesting people, many of whom I've
remained in contact with since. I also enjoyed just walking around Lyon.
Oh, yeah…and Lyon has much better free WiFi coverage than Brussels.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the questions, and the opportunity to talk with

you've been there since the beginning, the most powerful feature of Ruby
is the community.</p>

<p>I'm Yannick a belgian developer. Working mainly in Ruby. I love burgers and ruby so it came out that organizing Rubyburgers was a pretty smart idea. I'm a new dad and that's the most fantastic project I ever made. You might also see me talk about beers or coffee.</p>

<h3 id="youre-giving-a-talk-at-rulu-this-year-what-will-you-talk-about">You're giving a talk at Rulu this year. What will you talk about?</h3>

<p>I decided that the Ruby community, and most specifically the Rails one, have to stop thinking that their database is just a datastore. So I'll speak about special use cases of Postgresql. How you can use it in ways you may have not think about yet. And how you can embrace that tool to have a blazing fast and awesome app.</p>

<p>Rulu is a small conference which is really about people. The format of the conference made possible for me to speak with so many great people. I remember asking Terence Lee, in a so shy way, why he liked his camera so much, and he answered me with the same passion he has with ruby. This is that kind of moment that make me come back every year at Rulu. Also your 'bouchons' are amazing.</p>

          <p>Before you can enjoy the wonder of the RuLu conference, you have to get to Lyon. Sleeping indoors always makes a conference more enjoyable as well. We'd like to help with both of those pursuits.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-lyon">Getting to Lyon</h2>
<p>If you're nearby, you can take a regional train (TER). From a little farther away, the TGV is your best bet. Out of TGV range? You'll be flying into Lyon's Saint Exupéry Airport.</p>

<h3 id="by-train">By Train</h3>
<p>In the  Rhône-Alpes region, the TER trains are cheap and convenient. Rserve your ticket on the <a href="http://www.voyages-sncf.com/">SNCF</a> site. Your destination is Lyon Part-Dieu, which is convenient because it is a transport hub with connections to busses, trams, and the Metro system.</p>

<p>Outside the region, check the <a href="http://www.voyages-sncf.com/">SNCF</a> or <a href="https://www.capitainetrain.com/en">CapitaineTrain</a> site for routes from your location to Lyon. The trains stop at Gare Part-Dieu and Perrache. Once you choose a place to stay, you can decide which endpoint is best for you.</p>

<h3 id="by-plane">By Plane</h3>
<p>Reserve a round-trip on the <a href="https://www.rhonexpress.fr/">Rhônexpress</a> to get from the airport to the city and back. You can buy your tickets onboard the train, but it's cheaper to reserve in advance and not difficult at all. After you land, follow the signs to the platform. The trains arrive every 15-30 minutes <a href="https://www.rhonexpress.fr/presentation/?rub_code=74">depending</a> on the time of day.
Choose a <a href="https://www.google.fr/flights/#search;t=LYS;d=2014-06-18;r=2014-06-22">flight</a> to LYS or check with your preferred discount airline or bucket shop.</p>

<h2 id="transport-within-the-city">Transport Within the City</h2>
<p>The transport operator in Lyon is <a href="http://tcl.fr">TCL</a>, and their web site is very useful. Open that site in a tab; after you decide where to stay, you can plan your route from the train station. The site will suggest Metro, bus or tram, or some combination. Look at later trips to see if there is a simpler one. There is also a great app if you have data service on your phone (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tcl/id579379606?l=fr&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.micropole.android.tcl_mobile&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5taWNyb3BvbGUuYW5kcm9pZC50Y2xfbW9iaWxlIl0.">Android</a>). There is free wifi in many locations, like the Gare Part-Dieu.</p>

<h2 id="sleeping-arrangements">Sleeping Arrangements</h2>
<p>There are many
<a href="https://www.google.com/hotels/#search;l=Lyon,+France;d=2014-06-18;n=4;usd=1;
si=5180ef17;av=r">hotels</a>
in Lyon, and of course <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Lyon--France">Airbnb</a> and
<a href="http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/europe/france/rhone-alpes/lyon">VRBO</a> can
help too. The conference venue is on the peninsula near the center of the city,
in the 2nd Arrondissement.</p>

<h3 id="sleepability">Sleepability</h3>
<p>Bellecour isn't too noisy unless there is an event there, like the <a href="http://www.fetedelamusique.culture.fr/en/International/presentation/">Fête de la Musique</a>. Which is on the 21st, so if you don't plan to get out and enjoy the music, you might not want to stay too close to the places where bands are playing.
Vieux Lyon has a ton of character, and it's also full of restaurants bars so you can expect noisy people to be leaving those bars around closing time. If you're planning to close the bars yourself, cool! The apartments and hotels in Vieux Lyon are old and interesting and charming.
Near Gare Part-Dieu there are a lot of hotels that don't generally have so much character, but they are close to transportation, and also close to <a href="http://www.hallespaulbocuse.lyon.fr/">Les Halles de Lyon - Paul Bocuse</a> where you can have a spectacular culinary experience. Remember that the trains run at night also, and pay attention to the location of the tracks relative to your hotel.
Of course there are many neighborhoods in Lyon and this is not an exhaustive list.</p>

          <p>Hopefully you have reserved some time to enjoy the city before and/or after RuLu. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon">Lyon</a> has a long and fascinating history. In the present, though, Lyon is the gastronomic capital of France as well as being designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<h2 id="fte-de-la-musique-in-lyon">Fête de la Musique in Lyon</h2>
<p>Friday is <a href="http://www.fetedelamusique.culture.fr/en/International/presentation/">Fête de la Musique</a> (World Music Day) and there is live music throughout the city! As the evening wears on, the streets, squares and parks of Lyon fill up with musicians putting on concerts - <a href="http://www.culture.lyon.fr/culture/sections/fr/festivals/musiques_actuelles/fete_de_la_musique/fete_de_la_musique">details here (in French)</a>. So, whatever you choose to do at the end of the day on the 21st, do make Fête de la Musique part of your plans!</p>

<h2 id="getting-information">Getting information</h2>
<p>The main information center in Lyon is in Place Bellecour. They also have a <a href="http://www.en.lyon-france.com/">website</a> that is worth checking out. There are many scheduled tours of various sights in Lyon, and you can sign up for the tours here. Place Bellecour is well worth a visit - it is the main square in Lyon and will feature heavily in the festivities of Fête de la Musique.</p>

<h2 id="visit-old-lyon-and-the-basilica-of-fourvire">Visit Old Lyon and the Basilica of Fourvière</h2>
<p>Old Lyon (Vieux Lyon) is an old and quaint neighborhood, great for a meandering walk. It is a favourite amongst tourists and locals alike. It features Cathedral St Jean and several public squares, and narrow cobblestone streets lined with restaurants, bars, creperies and pubs. There is also a tourism office just outside the Metro station if you forgot to pick up a map when you visited Bellecour.</p>

<h3 id="fourviere-and-roman-amphitheaters">Fourviere and Roman Amphitheaters</h3>
<p>One of several funiculars in Lyon can take you to Fourvière, or if you are not averse to a climb, you can walk up to the Basilica of Fourvière and visit the ruins of the Gallo Roman amphitheatre. There is a guided tour or you can make your own up by arming yourself with a map and getting to the Vieux Lyon Metro stop (on the D line, one stop west of Bellecour) and exploring the narrow streets of the quartier. There are a lot of Bouchons (restaurants typical of the Lyon area) in this area but be warned that some of them are overpriced tourist traps. It's hard to go wrong with a scoop of ice cream or a crepe as you take in the sights. The view of Lyon from Fourvière is quite something and the walk through the gardens to the Basilica is very pleasant, so, if it’s good weather, this is a good way to build up an appetite!</p>

<h2 id="explore-croix-rousse">Explore Croix-Rousse</h2>
<p>Croix-Rousse is bohemian Lyon at it’s best! This quartier features some of Lyon’s best independent art, craft, food and drink. Want a souvenir to take home? You’ll find something original here for sure! Explore the <a href="http://www.lyontraboules.net/parcours.php">traboules</a> and if you have some time, walk through the new <a href="http://www.grandlyon.com/Tunnel-de-la-Croix-Rousse.2886.0.html">tunnel</a> and enjoy the light show.</p>

<h2 id="pink-robot-girl">Pink-Robot-Girl</h2>
<p>Start at the Hotel de Ville metro stop (on the A line), check out the sights around the Opera and Place des Terreaux, and then head uphill. You can find awesome, locally designed t-shirts at Laspid in Place du Griffon, some of Lyon’s best coffee at Cafe Mokxa (3, Rue de l’Abbé Rozier) and lots of studios and boutiques as you wander up the Montée de la Grande Côte to the center of Croix-Rousse. At the top you get majestic views over the presquile.</p>

<p>If you feel like a beer after your climb, suggest checking out Dikkenek Cafe at 3 rue d’Austerlitz, close to the center of Croix-Rousse. They have a variety of beers on tap, and several delicious charcuterie options.</p>

<h2 id="check-out-the-parc-de-la-tete-dor">Check out the Parc de la Tete d'Or</h2>
<p>Feel like escaping the urban village? Head to 117 hectares of beautiful parkland in the north of Lyon. The Parc de la Tete d’Or is a great place to go for a stroll or a run. It has a lake (where you can rent a pedal boat!), a zoo, and it is right next to Lyon’s museum of modern art, the Musée d’art Contemporain de Lyon. You can get to the park by walking there from the Massena metro stop (line A) or taking a bus to the Museum (the C5 from Place Bellecour).</p>

<p>Don't forget your hat and sunblock, grab your map and enjoy the city! Share your discoveries with your fellow RuLu attendees</p>

          <p>This year's RuLu venue is <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Com%C3%A9die+Od%C3%A9on&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=Com%C3%A9die+Od%C3%A9on,+Rue+Grol%C3%A9e,+Lyon,+France">Comédie Odéon</a>, "the most beautiful cafe/theatre in France". Only three short blocks from the Cordeliers stop on the Metro A line, it is very close to the historic center of Lyon at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_Bellecour">Bellecour</a> and the charm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix-Rousse">Croix Rousse</a>.</p>

<p>Comédie Odéon was remodeled two years ago, and the interior is modern where it counts. The sound is clear even on the balcony, and the seats are very comfortable. Speaking of seats, there are plenty of them so you can sit with your friends. There is an attached bar with room for all of us to socialize.</p>

<h3 id="getting-to-the-venue">Getting to the Venue</h3>

<p>The most painless way to get to Comédie Odéon is by Metro. On the <a href="http://www.tcl.fr/">TCL</a> site, your destination is "Cordeliers, Lyon 2eme (Arrêt)". After you arrive at the Cordeliers stop, go east toward the Rhône on Rue Grenette for one block, then turn right on Rue Grolée.</p>

<h3 id="after-rulu">After RuLu</h3>
<p>Lyon is full of things to do, see, and eat. Rue Merciere is a few blocks from the venue, a beautiful cobblestone street full of interesting restaurants. A 10-minute walk will take you to Vieux Lyon where you can take a funicular to see the Roman amphitheatre, or to Fourvière for spectacular views of the city. Or ask a local; we all love to show off our city.</p>
